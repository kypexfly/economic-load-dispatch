# Economic Load Dispatch

Economic Load Dispatch for **thermal generators** *with* and *without* losses for MATLAB and Python. Algorithms are based on Power Generation, Operation, and Control, Allen J. Wood, Bruce F. Wollenberg, Gerald B. Shebl√© (2013).

Economic load dispatch without losses uses the following methods:
* Binary search method: <code>binary_search(data, PD)</code>
* Iterative lambda method: <code>iterative_lambda(data, PD)</code>

Economic load dispatch with losses uses iterative method. Power loss function maximum degree is 2nd order:
* Iterative with losses: <code>iterative_w_losses(data, PD, Ploss)</code>

## How to use (Python)
1. Download <code>ELD.py</code>
2. Create a Jupyter Notebook in the same folder.
3. <code>from ELD import X</code>, where X is the name of the methods mentioned above.
4. Create a <code>numpy.array()</code> containing the cost functions and their generation limits in the form of: <code>[a, b, c, Pmin, Pmax]</code>. See [tutorial](https://github.com/kypexfly/economic-load-dispatch/new/master?readme=1).
5. Call the function.

## Notes
* If you find any error/problem I would appreciate any feedback.
* Code might not work as intented, it's not finished yet imo.
* MATLAB code is being developed, but it's almost the same as Python code. Note that MATLAB runs faster than Python but for everyday case you wouldn't note it.
