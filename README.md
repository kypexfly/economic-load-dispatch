# Economic Load Dispatch

Economic Load Dispatch for **thermal generators** *with* and *without* losses for MATLAB and Python. Algorithms are based on Power Generation, Operation, and Control, Allen J. Wood, Bruce F. Wollenberg, Gerald B. Shebl√© (2013).

Economic load dispatch without losses uses the following methods:
* Binary search method: <code>binary_search(data, PD)</code>
* Iterative lambda method: <code>iterative_lambda(data, PD)</code>

Economic load dispatch with losses uses iterative method. Power loss function maximum degree is 2nd order:
* Iterative with losses: <code>iterative_w_losses(data, PD, Ploss)</code>

## How to use (Python)
1. Download <code>ELD.py</code>
2. Create a Jupyter Notebook in the same folder.
3. <code>from ELD import X</code>, where X is the name of the methods mentioned above.
4. Create a <code>numpy.array()</code> containing the cost functions and their generation limits in the form of: <code>[a, b, c, Pmin, Pmax]</code>. See [tutorial](https://github.com/kypexfly/economic-load-dispatch/blob/master/ELD%20Python/tutorial.ipynb).
5. Call the function.

## How to use (MATLAB)
1. Download ELD MATLAB folder.
2. Edit data.m with your own cost functions and generation limits.
3. Open any method you wish: binary_search, iterative_lambda for ELD without losses, or iterative_w_losses for ELD with losses.
4. Choose PD value and/or Ploss function.
5. Run code (F5)
 
## Notes
* If you find any error/problem I would appreciate feedback.
* Note that MATLAB runs faster than Python but for everyday case you wouldn't note it.
